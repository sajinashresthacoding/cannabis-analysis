# Racial Disparities in NYC Cannabis Arrests: A 30-Year Analysis
An analysis of cannabis-related arrests over time in New York, using Pandas to clean, filter, and visualize data by race.

## Context:
This project was developed to support a [story](https://sajinashresthacoding.github.io/cannabis-website/) I worked on with a fellow journalist about cannabis equity in New York Cityâ€™s licensing process for cannabis businesses. It provides context on the prioritization of justice-involved individuals for retail cannabis licenses while also highlighting the challenges they face in accessing these licenses. By examining historical cannabis arrest data, this analysis underscores the need for accessible licensing pathways to promote equity within the cannabis industry.

## Findings: 
I took the findings from my plot in my Jupyter Notebook and updated it on DataWrapper by adding context.

## Data Cleaning and Analysis:
* Used Pandas fundamentals such as queries, strings, and plot to find, clean, and map the data
* Consolidated extracted data into a structured CSV file.
* Enhanced findings by adding key context and annotations to the graph using DataWrapper.
